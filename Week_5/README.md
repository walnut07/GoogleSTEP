# Google STEP 2022: Travelling Salesman Problem Challenges
The problem instruction follows the Kurumi's documentation.

# Approaches
### 1. Greedy
### 2. 2-opt

# 1. Greedy
It visits the nearest point from the current point.

## Result
The greedy approach seemed to find the most optimal tour where n = 5 or n = 8. However, when N is 16 or more, the result tour does not look like very optimal. From the pictures below, it is clear that the more points there are, the more crosses in the tour.<br>
n = 5
![greedy n = 5](greedy_n=5.png)

n = 8
![greedy n = 8](greedy_n=8.png)

n = 16
![greedy n = 16](greedy_n=16.png)

n = 64
![greedy n = 64](greedy_n=64.png)

n = 128
![greedy n = 128](greedy_n=128.png)

## How to run
```shell
python3 solver_greedy.py input_{0~6}.csv >output_{0~6}.csv  
```
You can lauch a server and use a visualizer by following the instruction at `Problem Instruction` part.

# 2-opt
In order to resolve the crosses caused by the greedy approach, I implemented the 2-opt approach.

The 2-opt way is based on the tour generated by the greedy approach. It generates a new path with four points. The middle two points are swapped in the new path. If the new path is shorter than the old path, I swap the middle two points.

## Result
There aren't any crosses at all in all the challenges.
For examplw, in the challenge 3, the visualization looks like this.
![two opt n = 64](two-opt_n=64.png)

Since the scores below is lower than other stundents' ones, I'm going to employ other approaches. At present, I'm going to employ or-opt and parallelization.
| Challenge   | Score (meters) |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Challenge 0 | 3,418.10   |
| Challenge 1 | 3,832.29 |
| Challenge 2 | 4,994.89 |
| Challenge 3 | 8,970.00 |
| Challenge 4 | 11,489.79|
| Challenge 5 | 21,363.60|
| Challenge 6 | 42,712.37 |

## How to run
```shell
python3 solver_2-opt.py input_{0~6}.csv >output_{0~6}.csv  
```

## Problem Statement

In this assignment, you will design an algorithm to solve a fundamental problem
faced by every travelling salesperson, called _Travelling Salesman Problem_
(TSP). I’ll explain TSP in the onsite class. TSP is very famous problem. See
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). You can
understand the problem without any difficulties.

Quoted from
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem):

> The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: Given a
> list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the
> shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the
> origin city?

## Assignment

The assignment is hosted on GitHub,
[https://github.com/hayatoito/google-step-tsp](https://github.com/hayatoito/google-step-tsp).

You can download the assignment by `git clone`:

```shellsession
git clone https://github.com/hayatoito/google-step-tsp
```

The repository includes sample scripts written in Python 3, rather than in
Python 2. It’s your responsibility to install Python 3 if you want to run the
scripts, though running the scripts is not mandatory.

There are 7 challenges of TSP in the assignment, from N = 5 to N = 2048:

| Challenge   | N (= the number of cities) | Input file  | Output file  |
| ----------- | -------------------------: | ----------- | ------------ |
| Challenge 0 |                          5 | input_0.csv | output_0.csv |
| Challenge 1 |                          8 | input_1.csv | output_1.csv |
| Challenge 2 |                         16 | input_2.csv | output_2.csv |
| Challenge 3 |                         64 | input_3.csv | output_3.csv |
| Challenge 4 |                        128 | input_4.csv | output_4.csv |
| Challenge 5 |                        512 | input_5.csv | output_5.csv |
| Challenge 6 |                       2048 | input_6.csv | output_6.csv |

See _Data Format Specification_ section to know the format of input and output
files.

### Your tasks

- Write a program, solving each TSP by designing and implementing an algorithm.
- Overwrite each output file, `output_{0-6}.csv`, with the output of your
  program.
- Enter the _path length_ of your output in the [scoreboard], for each
  challenge. Needless to say, a shorter path is better then a longer path.

### Visualizer

The demo page of the visualizer is
[here](https://hkocinneide.github.io/google-step-tsp/visualizer/build/default/).

The assignment includes a helper Web page,
`visualizer/build/default/index.html`, which visualizes your solutions. You need
to run a HTTP server on your local machine to access the visualizer. Any HTTP
server is okay. If you are not sure how to run a web server, use the following
command to run the HTTP server. Make sure that you are in the top directory of
the assignment before running the command.

```shellsession
python -m http.server # For Python 3
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 # If you don’t want to install Python 3
```

Then, open a browser and navigate to the
[http://localhost:8000/visualizer/build/default/](http://localhost:8000/visualizer/build/default/).

Visualizer was only tested by Google Chrome. Using the visualizer is up-to you.
You don’t have to use the visualizer to finish the assignment. The visualizer is
provided for the purpose of helping you understand the problem.

See
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/)
to know how to enable GitHub pages on your repository.

## Data Format Specification

### Input Format

The input consists of `N + 1` lines. The first line is always `x,y`. It is
followed by `N` lines, each line represents an i-th city’s location, point
`xi,yi` where `xi`, `yi` is a floating point number.

```
x,y
x_0,y_0
x_1,y_1
…
x_N-1,y_N-1
```

### Output Format

Output has `N + 1` lines. The first line should be “index”. It is followed by
`N` lines, each line is the index of city, which represents the visitation
order.

```
index
v_0
v_1
v_2
…
v_N-1
```

### Example (Challenge 0, N = 5)

Input Example:

```
x,y
214.98279057984195,762.6903632435094
1222.0393903625825,229.56212316547953
792.6961393471055,404.5419583098643
1042.5487563564207,709.8510160219619
150.17533883877582,25.512728869805677
```

Output (Solution) Example:

```
index
0
2
3
1
4
```

These formats are requirements for the visualizer, which can take only properly
formatted CSV files as input.

## Schedule

### The class begins: 2022-06-03 (Fri) 6:40pm (JST)

I'll explain the "TSP" assignment.

Action items on Friday:

1.  Fill out your name in the first column of the [Scoreboard]:

2.  Fork this repository into your own GitHub.

### Coding: From: 2022-06-03 (Fri) 8:00pm - To: 2022-06-10 (Fri) 5:00pm

Until next Friday, you are expected to improve your algorithm and enter
the score in the [scoreboard] manually for each challenge. You can update the
score as many times as needed. I highly recommend you to update your score
whenever you can find a shorter path.

Feel free to submit, or continue working on this assignment past next Friday. I
will go over the results in class next week, so if you want to show off how well
you did on the leaderboard, submit by classtime!

## What’s included in the assignment

To help you understand the problem, there are some sample scripts / resources in
the assignment, including, but not limited to:

- `solver_random.py` - Sample stupid solver. You never lose to this stupid one.
- `sample/random_{0-6}.csv` - Sample output files by solver_random.py.
- `solver_greedy.py` - Sample solver using the greedy algorithm. You should beat
  this definitely.
- `sample/greedy_{0-6}.csv` - Sample output files by solver_greedy.py.
- `sample/sa_{0-6}.csv` - Yet another sample output files. I expect all of you
  will beat this one too. The solver itself is not included intentionally.
- `output_{0-6}.csv` - You should overwrite these files with your program's
  output.
- `output_verifier.py` - Try to validate your output files and print the path
  length.
- `input_generator.py` - Python script which was used to create input files,
  `input_{0-6}.csv`
- `visualizer/` - The directory for visualizer.

Details are intentionally omitted here. It is your responsibility to understand
the contents of the repository.

## Code of Conduct

- Since we are competing for the best algorithm, please do not cheat:
- You can get an assistance only from other STEP students, mentors, or
  lecturers..
- Don't get any assistance from any other people (e.g. your friends, professors,
  etc).
- Use your best judgment when using third party libraries. If it will be
  non-trivial for a reviewer to understand the library, it may be doing too
  much work that you could be learning from.
- It is okay to use built-in libraries provided by programming languages, of
  course.

## Tips for Development

The following tips might be helpful:

- Commit often, and push often. Small commits are easy to review, and are
  unlikely to conflict others' changes.

- Your code should be consistency well formatted. Please make sure to use
  appropriate code formatter, if you are not in confident. Don't try to format
  your code by yourself if a tool can do that.

## FAQ

This FAQ includes the questions and the answers in the past years, as is. Some
Q/A might be obsolete for this year.

- Q. I found a typo in this document.

- A. Please feel free to send a
  [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), as a
  practice, or file an issue at [GitHub Issues] if you are not confident using
  git.

- Q. Do I have to use the same code for every challenge?

- A. No.

- Q. Is there any limitation of machine resources I can use? Can I use multiple
  machines? Can I run my algorithm 24 hours?

- A. No limitation at all. You can use any machine resources you have.

- Q. It seems that this document and the scoreboard are publicly viewable. Is
  this intentional?

- A. Yes. I am a fan of transparency. If you have any concerns, please let me
  know that. I’ll honor your preference. Don’t enter any confidential
  information.

- Q. Can I look other student's repository?

- A. Yes. Don't try to hide anything. Eveything should be open. It's fine to
  exchange ideas between students, or borrow their ideas.
